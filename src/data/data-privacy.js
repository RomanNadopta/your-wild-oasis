  #### Data retention and deletion.

  Our commitment to safeguarding your personal information extends to the duration of our engagement with you and beyond, in adherence to both contractual obligations and regulatory mandates. The duration for which we retain your data is contingent upon several factors, including the nature of the information gathered, the original intent behind its collection, and the legal stipulations of the pertinent jurisdictions. Typically, this encompasses the jurisdiction of your residence, as well as the jurisdiction associated with the property where you've booked accommodation or services, if applicable. Rest assured, our data retention practices are designed to ensure compliance while upholding the highest standards of privacy and security.

  As part of our commitment to transparency and responsibility in handling personal data, we maintain your information following our legal obligations. This includes retaining and reporting data for tax, auditing, and regulatory compliance purposes. Additionally, we may retain certain personal information to further our legitimate business interests, such as enhancing our fraud detection capabilities or safeguarding against actual or potential legal claims from you or third parties. Our data retention practices aim to strike a balance between fulfilling legal obligations and protecting the interests of both our organization and those we serve.

  When you interact with our services, such as by leaving a review or engaging with third parties, it's important to understand that the information you share may remain accessible to the public or those third parties even if we delete it from our systems. This means that once information is shared beyond our platform, we may not have control over its continued visibility or accessibility. We encourage users to be mindful of the information they share and to review the privacy policies of third parties they engage with to understand how their data may be handled.
  
  Even after we remove your information, certain elements may persist in aggregated, anonymized, or tokenized formats, dissociated from personal identifiers. Additionally, due to our routine system backups, fragments of your data might remain in backup copies for a period after its deletion from our primary systems. If you utilize our mobile application for Wild Oasis guests or Wild Oasis homeowners and opt to delete your user account within the app, we will retain specific account-related reservation and transaction details as necessary to fulfil any pertinent legal obligations or to address our legitimate business interests. These interests may encompass assisting or defending against actual or potential legal claims, whether initiated by you or a third party.

  #### Lawful bases to collect, use, and share your personal information.

  We are committed to collecting, using, and sharing your personal information only when we have a lawful basis to do so. These lawful bases include:

  * **Consent:** Where you have given us your consent, we may collect, use, and share your personal information accordingly. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
  * **Legitimate Interests:** We may process your data when it is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, provided those interests are not overridden by your rights and interests. This could include fraud prevention, improving our services, or asserting legal claims.
  * **Applicable Law:** Applicable Law: We may collect, use, and share your personal information as otherwise allowed by applicable law and consistent with our Privacy Policy.

  Wild Oasis operates in multiple jurisdictions within Europe. We process data both within and outside Europe, and we may share your data among affiliated companies or with service providers based in countries other than your country of residence or the country where services are provided to you.

This ensures compliance with relevant privacy regulations and safeguards for your data.

  #### Safeguards in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

  Information collected within Europe may indeed be transferred, processed, or stored outside Europe as outlined in this Privacy Policy. In such cases, we take appropriate measures to ensure that an adequate level of data protection is maintained. These safeguards may include:

  * Reliance on a determination by the European Commission or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner that the country outside Europe provides an adequate level of data protection.
  * Utilization of model contract clauses approved by the European Union or Swiss data protection authorities.
  * These measures are implemented to ensure that your personal information is protected following European data protection standards, regardless of its location outside of Europe.
  
  #### Additional privacy rights.

  Depending on the laws of the country or state in which you reside, you may possess additional rights regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. These rights are elaborated upon in detail after this Privacy Policy.

  #### What types of cookies does Wild Oasis use?

  When you visit and use a Wild Oasis website, Wild Oasis or a third party may place some cookies in your browser. Some cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. Cookies placed by the website you’re visiting (in this case, a Wild Oasis site) are sometimes called “first-party cookies,” while cookies placed by other companies are sometimes called “third-party cookies.”

  In general, there are four different types of cookies, which are explained below. Wild Oasis routinely uses all four types of cookies.

  * **Essential Cookies.** These first-party cookies are also known as “strictly necessary” cookies, and as the name suggests, they are necessary to allow you to move around the Wild Oasis site and use its features, such as “Save and View Favorites.”
  * **Analytics Cookies.** Also known as “performance cookies,” analytics cookies collect information about visits to our sites and how the services we offer are being used. We use this data to make improvements and report our performance. For example, these cookies collect information about how visitors use our sites, which site the visitor came from, the number of each user’s visits and how long a user stays on the site. We might also use analytics cookies to test new ads, pages, or features to see how users react to them. Analytics cookies are primarily third-party cookies.
  * **Functionality Cookies.** Sometimes called “preference cookies,” these first-party cookies allow us to remember information you have entered or choices you have made (such as your username, language, region, and marketing preferences) on our sites, so the next time you visit the site you will not have to set them again. These cookies also allow us to provide a better user experience on our website.
  * **Targeting Cookies.** Wild Oasis and our advertising partners or other third-party partners may use these types of cookies, also known as “advertising cookies,” to deliver advertising and track ad performance, and enable advertising networks to deliver ads that may be relevant to you based upon your activities (this is sometimes called “behavioral” or “targeted” advertising) on our sites.

  #### Do you use any other user tracking technologies?

  Wild Oasis may use other technology that is standard to the Internet, such as pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies, to track visitors to our sites.
  
  #### Do Not Track disclosure.

  Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. For information about Do Not Track, visit www.allaboutdnt.org. At this time, Wild Oasis does not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. Internet-standard tracking tools may be used by us and by third parties to collect information about you and your Internet activity, as disclosed in our Privacy Policy, even if you have turned on the Do Not Track signal.
